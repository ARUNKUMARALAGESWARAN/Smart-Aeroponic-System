# Smart-Aeroponic-System
A smart aeroponic system is a modern agricultural approach that combines aeroponics with digital technologies to grow plants efficiently without soil. In this system, plant roots are suspended in the air inside a closed or semi closed chamber and are periodically sprayed with a fine mist of water mixed with essential nutrients.
